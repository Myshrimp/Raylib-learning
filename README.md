# Raylib-learning 
1.How to use raylib quickly:
Firstly,After downloading raylib,open its file folder,goto raylib/npp, and open notepad for raylib,press F6 to run it.
Secondly,go to raylib/raylib/projects,and select the file with the name of IDE you are using,then you will find a project existing there,open it and you will find a lot of examples in it.You can write your own project on the basis of the current codes now.Of course,you can create a back-up file folder beforehand in case you want to learn from the example codes.
2.Things to be mentioned.
This is a project recording my own process of learning raylib,therefore my solutions on questions I meet may not be viable to anyone else,they are not standard ones.
If you have better ideas and solutions,I would be grateful if you share them with me.Leave a comment if you like!
