When using DrawText() function,if you pass in a FormatText() and get an error report,you should use TextFormat() instead.
If you include some head files like algorithm.h,Windows.h and so on, you cannot run the project,it seems they are conflict with raylib.h
You should load files of image or texture AFTER the InitWindow() function,or the project will crush.Likewise,it is better to load audios after InitAudioDevice().
If you want to load numbers of one single image,you should create an array of that type and draw them each by each,using a for-loop of course.
